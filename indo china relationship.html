It is the first deadly clash in the border area in at least 45 years. 


The Indian army said a three of its soldiers had been killed during the clash in Ladakh, followed by  a number of critically injured soldiers died of their wounds. With the fatalities suffered by both the sides. 
India's external affairs ministry accused China of breaking an agreement struck the previous week to respect the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in the Galwan Valley.
India has accused China of sending armed forces and says China occupies 38,000sq km of it's territory. In the last three decades, divergent rounds of talks have failed to resolve the boundary disputes.
 
China did not confirm any fatalities, but accused India in turn of crossing the border onto the Chinese side. There are several reasons why tensions are rising now- but grappling strategic goals lie at the root, and both sides blame each other. 


India has built a new road in what reports say is the most remote and vulnerable area along the LAC in Ladakh, and India's decision to ramp up infrastructure seems to have infuriated Beijing. Border patrols have often bumped into each other, resulting in occasional scrimmage. But no bullets have been fired in four decades. That is why the clash caused months of roiling tension. 


The two countries have fought only one war so far, in 1962, when India suffered a humiliating defeat. In May, thousands of Indian and Chinese soldiers exchanged physical blows on the border in the north-eastern state of Sikkim. And in 2017, the two countries clashed in the region after China tried to extend a border road through a disputed plateau.


Keeping the results aside, the latest incident  triggered a fresh wave of anti-China sentiments in India.</p></div></div><div class="columns">
                            <div class="column" id='section2'><div class="head"><span class="headline hl3">Rising India China border tension</span></div><p>The June 15 incident in the broiled Galwan Valley, a tedious Himalayan area along the Line of Actual Control (LAC). The clash between the armed forces of China and India left 20 Indian soldiers dead. China has yet to officially declare its casualties.


The heightened tensions between the world's two most densely populated countries have drawn international concerns, with the United Nations urging both sides "to exercise maximum restraint."


The clash was triggered by a disagreement over two Chinese tents, that Indian officials said, had been built on it's side of the LAC. According to the reports, the Chinese soldiers used iron rods and batons with spikes, killing the Indian soldiers and wounded many other.

However, China has not said anything about any losses in the combat. V.K Singh, Indian federal minister for roads and transport and a former army chief, claimed China lost at least 40 soldiers in the clash, without providing any evidence.


India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi declared the denial of a Chinese incursion. The reaction in India to Chinese advances has been one of outrage, with citizens and trade associations calling for the Modi-led government to boycott Chinese goods.
Protesters across the country were seen burning Chinese flags and products, while videos on social media showed teenagers destroying their Chinese-made mobile phones. The trade imbalance between the two is significant, and favours China heavily. Shyam Saran, former Indian foreign secretary, claiming that it would be impossible for New Delhi to find alternative suppliers in the near future.


A trilateral summit between India, China and Russia is to be scheduled. The virtual meeting, to be attended by India's foreign minister, is likely to address the border standoff. Meanwhile, the Indian and Chinese armies are also talking on the LAC to defuse the tensions.</p></div></div><div class="columns">
                            <div class="column" id='section3'><div class="head"><span class="headline hl3">China Encroaching Nepal's Land Impact on India</span></div><p>Border between countries is a sensitive issue which may lead to dispute. Sometimes, debate on border creates the situation of war between countries. From ancient time to date, Nepal has been regarded as an independent and sovereign country. Nepal is surrounded by India by three sides. Due to open and unregulated border system, border problem is increasing day by day. In comparison to other sides, we can see more encroachment to South Side. After Sugali treaty, it started to increase gradually. The border territory encroachment has not stopped yet. Basically there are two reasons to continue encroachment:  One reason is political instability in Nepal and another is political instability in Nepal and another is political parties have been passing their time to form dissolve the government. Political parties are not paying attention to this issue. Nepal does not face this with China due to Himalayan range but it has been always facing issues due to open and plain area in India border. 

India and Nepal have a strong bilateral relation performed was a significant role in Himalayan frontiers. India and Nepal shared deep cultural, economic, social, and political relations over many centuries. The ties between both countries frayed slowly started from the border disputes that arose after defense minister Rajnath Singh inaugurated a crucial road going through lipulekh to Kailash and Manasarovar, that route could quickly build connectivity within India with the Tibetan Plateau. The Nepal government protested that it could challenge the national sovereignty and status quo and fueled the back of India movement in Nepal, which became a principal reason for bilateral instability in both countries. Nepal proclaims 400 sq km of Indian land in Kaalapani , Lipulekh, and Limpiyadhura as part of Nepal territory. Kathmandu sends the new political map to the United Nations and Google for international recognition. India and Nepal claim the same disputed territory on their political map.

 India was the primary trade partner of Nepal, more than 65% of Nepal’s trade deals are possible through the Indian ports, so India dominated a larger scale in Nepal import and export sectors. In the meantime, China attempts to replace India’s position in Nepal’s economic and political domain. And has even occupied one of the village in Nepal because of which the netizens had become citizens of China by default. More over China has diverted the file of many a river from Nepal. And had start constructing roads which is a threat to the Nepal as well as India. As no sooner the road will be complete China set up the military camp, this will make an easy access to the border.

If encroachment of Nepal's land continues at the current rate,  this will impact India as well. It could even end Nepal existence in the near future and they move towards India even with high pace. Hence, border issue should be solved as soon as possible.</p></div></div><div class="columns">

1. In Jawaharlal Nehru Era (1954)  mistakes done are:-

 Refusing invitation of permanent membership of UN Sec.Council membership in favour of China and accepting Tibet as a part of china mainland, he avoided India’s legitimate claim over Tibet and remained inactive when China occupied Tibet.
Nehru also donated the UN permanent seat to China without any reason.


2.  Atal Bihari Vajpayee (2003) -

 Vajpayee government officially accepted Tibet as a autonomous part of China.  


3. Narendra Modi (2015 ~ 2020) - 

Mistakes in modern era by Modi government were high level of Appeasement Policy, Overtrading with China, making government contracts to chinese company.
No effective step was taken after Indo china clash, regular visits of Modi, RSS leaders and BJP Leader to China in four to five years.
China took the kashmir issue at UNSC multiple times at the behest of pakistan, India did said that it's their internal matter but didn't say much about about Hong-Kong. Currently India stayed silent on mishandling of Coronovirus by China and never took strict action against China before barbaric attack on Indian soldiers.</p></div></div><div class="columns">
                            <div class="column" id='section5'><div class="head"><span class="headline hl3">Pakistan China intelligence sharing Deal Impact on India</span></div><p>On May 2020 china and Pakistan celebrated their 69th anniversary of formal diplomatic ties. A spokesman from china said their relation with Pakistan is "firm as a rock".


Pakistan China intelligence sharing deal is a threat for India. As per reports China is targeting to fulfill few agreements which could trouble India's peace. The objective mainly includes denying Uighurs a safe place in Afghanistan. Reportedly they have even requested Taliban not to support Uighurs.
China even aim economic expansion in the region and also trying to take belt and road initiative of Afghanistan.


Obviously, this will effect India's peace. China has a advance technical intelligence capability than Pakistan, and it needs no assistance in this. It also has some human intelligence capability among the Tibetans spread out in regions of India.


Pakistan has had various operations into India for decades, particularly on movement of troops that were of low-level technology. Sources also point about an increase in Pakistani intel activity during the Galwan stand-off, indicating that the human intelligence capability is being outsourced to Islamabad, which is speculated to have been done by china.


What even more worrying is that Pakistan is now willing, or has been forced, to go the extra mile in intelligence sharing — an area that is traditionally regarded as central to national security. This makes the future even more un predictable regarding the peace of India.</p></div></div><div class="columns">

The site lies in Pakistan occupied Kashmir (POK). Though 3 Pakistani PM had inaugurated dam in last fifty years as they call it a historic project.


For the above project China is helping pakistan to construct the dam on Indus river in POK's chilas. In May 2020, Pakistan government signed a whopping Rs 442 billion (USD 5.8 billion) contract for a joint venture between Chinese state-run. It's a joint venture with china owning 70% stalk whereas Pakistan hold 30% stalk. 


Earlier in August 2012 world bank and Asian development Bank has refused funding for the dam. For the above funding Pakistan was asked to get an NOC from India first, which was gradually not given by India.
 
Same as then even now India is not in favour of construction of the dam, as said by Anurag Srivastava spokesperson of, MEA. "Our position remains unchanged on Dismer Basha Dam. Entire Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh integral inalienable part of India. We have strongly protested against the construction of the dam. As dam will submerge large part of Indian territory under its illegal occupation."


Despite objection from India, China said, that it is part of a "win-win" bilateral cooperation to help the wellbeing of the local people. It is being called disputed project due to its legal tangles.</p></div></div><div class="columns">

#BoycottChina is currently one of the trending topics in India. Indian traders launch massive 'China Quit India' to boycott Chinese goods and called for "Bhartiya Saamaan Hamara Abhimaan."  The Confederation of All India Traders(CAIT) members have held a protest at about 600 places across the country against Chinese goods. 


Reducing trade with China will not be so easy as 'Made in India' is not so successful till  date. On Facebook, twitter Boycott China is trending but at the same time we are seeing that in our E-commerce websites, electronic shops across country smartphone, electronic goods made in china, sells out within minutes. Even our Automobile Industry, Pharmaceutical Industry are largely dependent upon China.
Raw material for Pharma, Consumer electronics, Steel, Heavy Machinery, Chemicals, Telecom goods, Rubber, Glass, Metal, Heavy machineries, Paper articials and many other major products are imported from China.

It's very tough for Indians to reduce consumption of Chinese products. As large population of India is poor and look for cheaper option which Chinese products fulfills.This is the main reason for China’s trade advantage and competitiveness. 

Goverment is taking many steps to reduce the inflow of Chinese products into Indian Markets. After #BoycottChina call, Chinese exports to India crash 24.7% in 2020; trade drops by 18.6%. China’s Huawei Technologies Co. and ZTE Corp. are set to be kept out of India’s plans to roll out its 5G networks, plans are also to increase the licence price of 300 Chinese products, which ultimately make these products a little more expensive than earlier which gradually result in less consumption.</p></div></div><div class="columns">
                            <div class="column" id='section9'><div class="head"><span class="headline hl3">Five Fingers and Palm Strategy of China</span></div><p>China warned India that it will open new fronts in the Himalayas soon after the violent face-off took place between Chinese and Indian soldiers in Ladakh along the Indo-Tibetan border, which will cost heavy load for both India and China.

At the height of coronavirus crisis in the world, all the media have focused on China’s military aggressions in Ladakh and Sikkim. But the root cause of China’s military incursions across the Indian Himalayan borders is barely known by the Indian public.

China’s military aggressions in India, Bhutan and Nepal is strategically designed by the Chinese communist leaders’ perception that Tibet is the palm and Himalayan regions are the five-fingers. China considered Tibet as the palm and Ladakh, Nepal, Sikkim, Bhutan and Arunachal Pradesh as the five-finger.

In the early 20th century, British India adopted it's forward policy towards Tibet for expanding her market and at the same time, British desired to establish Tibet a buffer against the Czarist Russia’s threat to India.

British successfully made Tibet a buffer state between Russia, China and British India after British India’s short invasion of Tibet in 1903. Subsequently, Chinese nationalists viewed British invasion of Tibet as a security threat to China from its backyard. British left India in 1947.

The Communist Party of China established the People’s Republic of China (PRC) on October 1, 1949. After that, China invaded Tibet in 1950. Subsequently, centuries old a zone of peace between India and China disappeared.

After China’s occupation of Tibet, the first ever Sino-Indian military face-off was seen in the world’s highest border – the Himalayas. Since then, more than thousands of Chinese military incursions took place across the Indian Himalayan borders.

By invading Tibet, China asserted Tibet as a treasure of it"s strategic asset to speed up China’s expansionist policy towards the Himalayan nations and beyond. And also, China’s militarization of the Tibetan plateau triggered the geopolitical tensions in South Asia.

China sees Tibet as a strategic passage to extend China’s geopolitical ambition in South Asia. Mao Zedong, the founding father of PRC and firm believer of Tsun Tzu’s strategic doctrine – “the Art of War”, strategized Tibet as the palm of China to expand its sphere of influence in South Asia.

China invaded and occupied Tibet in order to bring the ”five-fingers” Himalayan regions under its supremacy.

The 2017 Doklam stand-off and recent China’s occupation of a Nepali village Rui Gaun of Gorkh district are just tip of the iceberg of China’s military aggressions in the five-fingers Himalayan regions.

Today, China is actively encroaching in the Himalayan borders of Ladakh, Nepal, Sikkim, Bhutan and Arunachal Pradesh for further encircling India to boost “China’s Strategy of Encirclement India”, which aim to an encircle India through different fronts.

Professor Ashok Kapur rightly illustrated “China’s Strategy of Encirclement India” in his book entitled “India and the South Asian Strategic Triangle”, where he writes “The China’s India war of 1962 created a military front in the Himalayan regions. The PRC-Pakistan strategic partnership has created a diplomatic with security and defence fronts against India. The encirclement of the Chinese port facilities in Myanmar, Sri Lanka and Pakistan has created commercial and trade fronts against India”. All these geostrategic tensions are strategic ramifications of China’s aggressive policy towards India.

Strategically, the Tibetans were the first line of the defence for India. They ultimately safeguarded the 3,488 kilometres long border from Ladakh to Arunachal Pradesh.

Since the disappearance of Tibet as a traditional buffer state between India and China in 1950, the two Asian giants faced military escalations in along the Indo-Tibetan border. The shifting of Indo-Tibetan border into Sino-Indian border itself has created unprecedented geopolitical enigma in the Himalayas

The centrality of Tibet issue in the Sino-Indian geostrategic relations is an ultimate resolution for resolving the Sino-Indian dispute over the Indo-Tibetan border. The renowned international scholars on China study such as Mohan Malik, Professor Dawa Norbu and Brahma Chellaney argues that Tibet lies at the heart of the Sino-Indian relations.

Professor Dawa Norbu explicitly said that “The crux of the Sino-Indian strategic rivalry is this: if the Chinese power elite consider Tibet to be strategically important to China, the Indian counterparts think it is equally vital to Indian national security”.

The present Chinese leadership has recognized the Tibet issue as a core issue of China’s national security and strategic engagement in South Asia. Thus, this is the right time for India to craft India’s new Tibet policy, because China’s strategizing Tibet as the China’s palm and Ladakh, Nepal, Sikkim, Bhutan and Arunachal Pradesh as the five-fingers of Tibet is not a rhetoric. It is happening in the Himalayas.




The claims over the "five fingers" were asserted "emphatically and frequently" from 1958 to 1961 over the Peking and Lhasa radio systems. During a mass meeting in Lhasa in July 1959, Chinese lieutenant general Zhang Guohua said: "Bhutanese, Sikkimese and Ladakhis form a united family in Tibet. They have always been subject to Tibet and to the great motherland of China. They must once again be united and taught the communist doctrine.</p></div></div><div class="columns">

The foundation of this impending “deal” between Beijing and Tehran was laid during President Xi Jinping’s visit to Iran in 2016.


Beijing and Tehran are nearing the conclusion of an extensive trade and military partnership. For Iran, such a deal could throw the embattled country a much-needed economic lifeline. Iran is already part of China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), and in September 2019 China announced its intent to infuse $400 billion worth in investments in Iran’s oil and gas, infrastructure and transportation sectors. These massive numbers are a direct challenge to both Western, and more specifically, American economic might on a regional and global stage, but also creating new geo-political flash points as Beijing expands its reach around the world, which now includes a base in Djibouti, operations of the Gwadar port in Pakistan, ever increasing naval port calls across the world and so on.



This week it was reported that China and Iran are in the process of signing a long-term, 25-year agreement valued at close to $400 billion. The agreement, proposed in 2016 by China, covers key sectors such as energy, infrastructure, and telecommunications and is likely to considerably expand China’s presence and influence in Iran. 



As per the agreement, China will invest in building Iranian infrastructure, and in return, Iran will supply energy resources to China for the next 25 years. The closer relationship between China and Iran will add a positive dimension to China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and has strategic implications for the geopolitics of the Middle East, balance of power in Asia and India’s security strategy.

Iran has been at the loggerheads with the United States and has been facing crippling sanctions owing to its nuclear program. Last year, the US decided to withdraw from the nuclear deal with Iran, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), signed in 2015 and to apply ‘maximum pressure’ on the Iranian regime. This has made it extremely difficult for Iran to export its energy resources. For example, since 2019, India has reduced energy imports from Iran significantly.

Iran and the US along with its regional allies such as Saudi Arabia are also engaged in a complex, proxy war in the broader Middle Eastern region including in civil wars and/or political competition in Syria, Iraq and Yemen. The US’ sanctions and aggressive foreign policy towards Iran have now resulted in Iran and China coming closer to each other. 


Iran and China share a similar outlook towards the US; both have an antagonistic relationship with it and are interested in reducing the US’ influence in world affairs. Both would like to challenge the existing balance of power in their respective regions and perhaps tilt it in their favour by kicking out the US. Glaring contradictions that exist in the political systems in China and Iran have not come in the way of the budding partnership. Iran is a theocratic state with a major role for religion in national affairs whereas China is a communist state and the Chinese Communist Party is officially atheist. Hard-nosed calculations of national interests always trump such contradictions as has happened in this case as well. 

China’s key partner in South Asia, Pakistan, and Iran have conflicting interests towards each other over the treatment of Shia Muslims, the question of Baluchistan and the political future of Afghanistan. Strengthening of the Sino-Iranian relationship is likely to influence the Iran-Pakistan relationship positively. China’s stakes in the $ 62-billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) and the promised investments in Iran are expected to provide the necessary glue for this relationship. India will not be pleased to see the cordial Iran-Pakistan relationship built with China’s nudging. 

For India, strategic developments do not bode well. Closer Sino-Iranian partnership is likely to result in further deteriorating the security environment in South Asia and in the Middle East. The implications of it will be felt not just in the Indo-Iranian bilateral relationship but also in Afghanistan and towards India’s desire to establish and regularise overland connectivity to Central Asia and Russia. 

Just as the news of Sino-Iranian partnership broke, it was also announced that Iran had dropped India from a key 623-km railway project that connected Chabahar port to the town of Zahedan and was expected to extend to Zaranj in Afghanistan. The timing of this announcement makes it even more remarkable. The railway project would have been crucial in facilitating India’s access to Afghanistan via Iran.

India is developing the port of Chabahar in Iran and managed to get the American waiver for the railway and the port project. However, India’s inability to build the railway in time has resulted in the exclusion of India from this project. India’s difficult balancing act between Iran and the US lies at the root of these tensions between the stated commitments and their actual implementation.

Iran moving into China’s orbit is an ominous development for India at a time when India-China relations are undergoing significant change and the Chinese navy is expanding its presence in the Indian Ocean.  Intensifying competition between China and the US is likely to strain many such relationships for India. The closer relationship between an energy-rich, geostrategically-located, significant Middle Eastern power like Iran with China complicates India’s external security dynamics. It is likely to test India’s ability to manoeuvre and respond to evolving strategic changes in its extended neighbourhood.</p></div></div></div>
